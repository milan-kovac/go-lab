# GO Lab

This repository represents my exploration of the Go programming language. It contains various smaller projects and experiments focused on understanding and mastering Go.  

The goal is to dive into Go's features, such as:  
- Concurrency and Goroutines  
- Package structure and modularity  
- Web development with Go  
- Error handling and best practices  
- Working with databases and external APIs  

Each project serves as a hands-on experiment to learn and apply Go concepts. ðŸš€
